I am a self-taught programmer with skills in Rust programming and security systems. Im currently learning web development, using the Yew framework.

In 2023, I completed an IT course at the Technical University of Berlin, covering general topics within programming, security, system administration, network management, and web development.

Through my usage/focus of NixOS, I enhanced my Linux and system/server management skills and am most interested in exploring the potential applications of NixOS in CI/CD environments.
