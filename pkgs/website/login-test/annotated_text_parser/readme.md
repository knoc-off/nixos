Nested Correction Annotation Format

I'll design a nested annotation format that allows for hierarchical error marking, enabling more complex corrections where one type of error can contain other types.
Proposed Nested Annotation Format

The format should use a clear syntax that:

    Allows nesting of different error types
    Maintains readability
    Is easy to parse programmatically
    Preserves the context of corrections

Basic Structure

text

[TYPE{original text|correction|optional explanation}]

Where:

    Square brackets [] denote the entire annotation
    Curly braces {} contain the content being corrected
    Pipe characters | separate the original text, correction, and explanation
    TYPE indicates the error category (TYPO, GRAM, PUNC, WORD, STYL, STRUC)

Nesting Syntax

For nested corrections, inner annotations would be placed within the "original text" portion of the outer annotation:

text

[STYL{This sentence has [GRAM{a error|an error}] and [TYPO{mispeling|misspelling}] that needs fixing.|This sentence has an error and misspelling that needs fixing.|Improved overall style while fixing grammar and spelling}]

Examples of Nested Annotations

    Style issue containing grammar and word choice errors:

    text

[STYL{The team [GRAM{is|are}] [WORD{leveraging|using}] their resources effectively.|The team are using their resources effectively.|Improved formality and fixed subject-verb agreement}]

Structural issue containing style and punctuation errors:

text

[STRUC{[STYL{In conclusion, to sum up|In conclusion}][PUNC{,|;}] the evidence suggests three outcomes.|In conclusion; the evidence suggests three outcomes.|Reorganized for clarity and fixed redundancy}]

Grammar issue containing typos:

text

    [GRAM{She [TYPO{definately|definitely}] [TYPO{dont|doesn't}] understand the concept.|She definitely doesn't understand the concept.|Fixed negative construction}]

Benefits of This Approach

    Hierarchical Analysis: Shows how errors relate to each other (e.g., a style issue might contain grammar errors)
    Contextual Corrections: Provides better context for why certain changes are made
    Comprehensive Feedback: Allows for more detailed and nuanced feedback
    Educational Value: Helps learners understand relationships between different types of errors

Implementation Considerations

When implementing this in your system, you would need to:

    Update the correction prompt to explain the new nested format
    Modify the error counting function to recursively count nested errors
    Adjust the scoring algorithm to properly weight nested errors
    Ensure the UI can display nested annotations in a user-friendly way

This nested annotation system would provide a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to essay correction while maintaining the clarity of the original format.
