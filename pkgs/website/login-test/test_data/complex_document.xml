  <suggestions>
    1. Consider using more specific examples to illustrate your points.
    2. The introduction would benefit from a clearer thesis statement.
    3. Try to vary your sentence structure more to improve readability.
    4. Add more transitions between paragraphs to improve flow.
    5. The conclusion could be strengthened by summarizing key findings more explicitly.
